# MinX
Extremely cut down and lightweight carriage for Voron V2.4 and Trident.

# Motivation
After using the stealthburner toolhead, I found that it did not meet my needs. The stealthburner toolhead is designed for many different hot end and extruder configurations, where I only use one (Orbiter + Dragon).

Therefore, it should be theoretically possible to build a much simpler toolhead assembly that is a lot lighter. I am thinking somewhere along the lines of the VZbot toolhead, but applied to the Voron ecosystem.


# Development roadmap
1) [IN PROGRESS] Develop proof of concept mount. The aim here is to mount the extruder, hot end, klicky and hot end fan. Concept CAD appears to work. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12782053/173062311-2f274d69-b048-4eb7-8347-2fae9f4a7e07.png)

2)  Develop part cooling fan shroud.
3)  Integrate into assembly and release.

Currently targetting a Dragon hotend for the initial release, followed by a Rapido.

There are no release dates for anything - they will be completed when they are ready.

# Installation
The following modifications are required for this toolhead:
1) Klicky mod
2) Removal of cable chains - recommend using CANBUS toolhead PCB
